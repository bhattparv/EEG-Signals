# Classifying Epileptic EEG Signals into Focal and Non-Focal Epilepsy
Developed a single pipeline to classify epileptic EEG signals using deep neural networks. Removed the requirement of feature extraction step involving complex feature engineering like entropies, time-frequency domain features, empirical mode decomposition, & discrete wavelet transform features.
